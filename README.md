# Python-Basics

Exercise 1 – Some Mathematics
Create two objects named “a” and “b”. Assign an integer value and a float value to them respectively. Print
out the type of the float object, and the sum of the two objects.

Exercise 2 – Printing
Write a few lines of code that prints out a tic-tac-toe board.

Exercise 3 – Strings
Create four string objects that take the values “Arizona”, “State”, “University”, and “ ” (a space). Try printing
out “Arizona State University” using the four objects (remember one can concatenate strings using the plus
sign).

Exercise 4 – Importing Libraries
In Python, importing libraries is a fundamental concept that allows us to access pre-built functionality
and tools to enhance our code. Recall that the syntax for importing libraries is to use the “import”
statement. For example,
import [library name]

Additionally, you can use an alias to give the library a shorter name, making it more convenient to use in
your code:
import [library name] as [alias]

You can also import specific components from a library, rather than importing the entire library, using
the from keyboard:
from [library name] import [component name]

Exercise 5 – Operators/Order of Operation
Transcribe the following equations into Python (without simplifying!), preserving order of operation with
parenthesis as needed. Save each as the value of a variable, and then print the variable.
If you aren’t familiar with modular arithmetic, it is straightforward - the modulus operator, in the
expression x mod y, gives the remainder when x is divided by y (use the math module whenever you need
it).
